TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

This project is discussed in chapter 6.

This project aims to implements a technical support system for customers of 
the DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

This project is only a first, rudimentary step towards the full solution.

PART 1
1. The complete version has a wide range of responses whereas the v1 only has one answer.


Part II
24. A HashMap is a class from the java.util package that uses the map(which is a collection of keys/values) to store values in sets of keys.

26. You use the get method.

28. It updates the value of the key.

29. It doesn't change anything, both keys will simply have the same value(ex: 2 people with the same phone number).

30. You use the get method.

31. The return is null.

32.You create a new method with an assignment to print all the keys. (System.out.println("All keys in the map:" + contacts.keySet()); ).

34.They are both generic classes, which means they need parameters. The ArrayList, like the map, can store entries, but as objects, unlike the map who can store pairs of objects.

35.

36. Nothing happens.
